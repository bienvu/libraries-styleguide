These USB ports are bi-directional and can be connected to peripherals like a printer, keyboard, barcode scanner, computer or EMR/LIS system. Available data formats are ASCII, ASTM and XML. Data parsing and translation may be required to work with your system. Contact your IT department, systems provider or Abaxis Technical Service at 1-800-822-2947 for assistance.</p><p>Existing customers can also download Abaxis Data Manager for free by clicking here. Data Manager is a free, unsupported utility that connects your Piccolo to a 32-bit Windows computer and formats the Piccolo results into a PDF and XML file. Many practices have found these files useful as an interim solution to full connectivity.</p>"
